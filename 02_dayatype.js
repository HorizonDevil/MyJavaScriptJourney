"use strict"; //to use and apply newer version of js

// alert(2+2) this function is not going to work because we are using node js and not browzer

console.log(3+2); console.log("abhishek") /* this  will definately work but not a good practice 
it compromises readibility */

// instead of this we will use proper spacing

console.log(2+2)

console.log("abhishek")

//tc39.es is the original documantation but in most of the cases we will be using MDN

let name= "abhishek" // string --> we can use either single quotes '' or double quotes " "
let number= 123 // number -> range is 2 to the power 53 but if the number is too big we use big INT
let isLoggedin = false // boolean --> either true or false

//null is a stand alone value
//undefined --> value is not assigned
//symbols --> for unique

//object 

//This are in general data types of javascript

console.log(typeof null);// null is defined as object
console.log(typeof undefined);// undefined is defined as undefined
